I just uploaded the initial version (v1.0.0) of the Opaque Quest Tracker plugin. This was requested by a friend to make the quest tracker text easier to read by placing an opaque window behind the quest tracker. The implementation was inspired by Thurallor's simpler implementation [url="https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?672011-Quest-Tracker-Opacity"]here[/url].

You can see it in action here:

You can change the opacity and lock the window in place through the options screen in the plugin manager:
